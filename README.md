My first blog

This is a learning project for me. To continue forward in my learning and keep my skills sharp. I have decided to blog about my life. About going back to college at the age of 40, being a woman and choosing such a competitive and fairly male dominated field, raising two children on my own at the same time, my weight loss journey through it all, and attempting to date!
