My first blog

This is a learning project for me. To continue forward in my learning and keep my skills sharp. I have decided to blog about my life. About being 40 and going back to college, choosing such a competitive and fairly male dominated field, raising to children on my own at the same time, my weight loss journey through it all, and attempting to date!
